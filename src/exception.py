'''This Python code snippet is designed to handle exceptions in 
a structured way, providing detailed error messages that include 
the script name, line number, and error message.
 error_message_detail function: This function is designed to format
   and return a detailed error message when an exception occurs. It 
   takes two parameters: error, which is the exception object, and 
   error_detail, which is expected to be a module that presumably 
   has an exe_info() method (likely a typo for sys.exc_info() from
     the sys module). The function extracts the traceback object
       from error_detail, then retrieves the filename and the line 
       number where the exception occurred. It formats these details
         into a string that includes the script name, line number, 
         and the error message, and returns this string.'''
